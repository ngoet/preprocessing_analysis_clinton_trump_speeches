# preprocessing_analysis_clinton_trump_speeches
This repository contains replication data and an R script for my blog post on sensitivity to pre-processing decisions, using campaign speeches from the US presidential election cycle of 2016.  For copyright reasons, the original speech data is not provided. Instead, the spreadsheet "speeches_urls.csv" contains the links to the speech transcripts.
